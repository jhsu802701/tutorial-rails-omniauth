Welcome to the [Ruby on Racetracks](http://www.rubyonracetracks.com/) Tutorial on OmniAuth!

## What's the Point?
In this tutorial, you will add the Omniauth feature to a Rails app.  This allows users (and admins) to log in through Google, Facebook, Twitter, or other popular services.

## Prerequisites
* Docker should be installed.  This is covered in the [Docker Tutorial](https://github.com/jhsu802701/tutorial-docker-stretch).
* You should have one of my rbenv-general Docker images installed.  This is covered in the [Docker Tutorial](https://github.com/jhsu802701/tutorial-docker-stretch).
* You should be familiar with the process of creating a new Rails app.  This is covered in the [GenericApp Tutorial](https://gist.github.com/jhsu802701/ace85adf7c3f197391c4457dec863e89).
